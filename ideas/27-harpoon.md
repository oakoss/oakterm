# Harpoon-Style Pane Bookmarks


Inspired by ThePrimeagen's Harpoon for Neovim. A small, ordered, persistent list of panes you jump to by index — like speed dial, not a contact list.

## The Problem

You have 8 panes open — 2 agents, a dev server, a test watcher, 2 shells, docker logs, and a scratch terminal. You constantly switch between 3-4 of them. Today that means:
- Clicking the sidebar
- Cycling through tabs
- Using the command palette to search

All of these require visual confirmation — you look, find, click. Harpoon replaces that with **deterministic muscle memory**.

## How It Works

### Mark

`Ctrl+Shift+M` — add the current pane to your harpoon list. It fills the first empty slot.

### Jump

Direct-jump by index, no prefix key needed:

```
Ctrl+1 → slot 1
Ctrl+2 → slot 2
Ctrl+3 → slot 3
Ctrl+4 → slot 4
```

That's it. Ctrl+1 always goes to the same pane. After 5 minutes, your fingers know: "my editor is 1, the agent is 2, dev server is 3, shell is 4."

### Quick Menu

`Ctrl+Shift+H` — toggle a floating overlay showing the harpoon list:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Harpoon                             │
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1  ● scratch       ~/project       │
│  2  ◉ feat/auth     claude  ❓       │
│  3  ▶ next dev      :3000           │
│  4  👁 vitest        14/14 passing   │
│  5  (empty)                          │
│  6  (empty)                          │
│                                      │
│  [Enter] jump  [d] remove  [↕] move │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Arrow keys to navigate, Enter to jump
- `d` to remove an entry
- Drag or `Shift+↑/↓` to reorder
- The list is editable — same UX as Harpoon's quick menu

### Automatic Cleanup

When a pane closes (agent merged, process exited), its harpoon slot becomes empty. The next `:mark` fills the empty slot. Slots don't collapse — if slot 2 closes, Ctrl+2 does nothing until you fill it again. This preserves muscle memory.

## Per-Workspace Scoping

Each workspace has its own harpoon list. Switch workspaces, switch harpoon context. The "work" workspace remembers your 4 panes, the "personal" workspace remembers different ones.

Harpoon lists persist across sessions — part of the session serialization.

## What Makes This Different From Tab Switching

| Feature | Tab switching (Cmd+1-9) | Harpoon |
|---------|------------------------|---------|
| Scope | All tabs by position | Curated subset you chose |
| Stability | Changes when you open/close/reorder tabs | Stable until you modify the list |
| Mental model | "My agent is the 3rd tab... wait, I opened a new one, now it's 4th" | "My agent is always Ctrl+2" |
| Size | Grows with every tab | Fixed at 4-6 slots |
| Persistence | Lost on restart (unless session restore) | Persisted, survives restarts |

## Configuration

```lua
harpoon = {
  slots = 6,                          -- max items in the list (default: 6)
  keybinds = {
    mark = "ctrl+shift+m",
    menu = "ctrl+shift+h",
    -- Direct jump keybinds
    ["1"] = "ctrl+1",
    ["2"] = "ctrl+2",
    ["3"] = "ctrl+3",
    ["4"] = "ctrl+4",
    ["5"] = "ctrl+5",
    ["6"] = "ctrl+6",
  },
  per_workspace = true,               -- separate list per workspace
  auto_remove_closed = true,          -- remove panes when they close
  preserve_scroll_position = true,    -- return to exact scroll position
}
```

## Implementation: Plugin

Harpoon is a bundled plugin, not core. It uses:
- `pane.metadata` — read pane info for the list display
- `pane.focus` — switch to a pane by ID
- `palette.command` — register `:harpoon` and `:mark`
- `hook.on_pane_close` — auto-remove closed panes
- `notify` — visual feedback on mark/jump
- Key registration for the direct-jump bindings

The core provides everything it needs. Someone could write an alternative (e.g., frecency-based auto-harpoon that learns your patterns) using the same primitives.

## Prior Art

- **Harpoon** (Neovim) — the original, for file bookmarks
- **tmux-harpoon** — port for tmux sessions (Alt+Q/W/E/R to jump)
- **Zellij Harpoon** — WASM plugin for Zellij panes
- **Tuxmux** — Rust tmux manager with a "jump list" inspired by Harpoon

No terminal emulator has this built in. Closest is Cmd+1-9 for tab switching, which is positional (fragile) rather than bookmarked (stable).
